## 🎯 Concept: "1 Element = 1 Page"

**My Portfolio** is not just a WordPress theme, but a complete philosophy of presenting oneself as a technological professional. Each page is created using the principle of maximum user focus on one key aspect of professionalism.

### 🏠 Home Page - "Portal Greeting"

**Concept**: The hero section doesn't just greet, but creates a "portal entry" effect, through which the user enters the world of a high-tech professional.

#### Unique Elements:
- **Neon console**: The title types character by character like in a high-tech interface terminal
- **Three-color scanning shadows**: Pink, purple, and cyan shadows pulse smoothly, creating a "scanning" effect
- **Portal transition**: The hero section itself smoothly becomes transparent, creating the sensation of entering a portal
- **"About Me" section activation**: The scanning shadows don't just disappear, but activate the appearance of the "About Me" section

#### Interactive Elements:
- Buttons with neon pulsing gradients
- Animated statistics blocks (50+ projects, 3+ years experience, 24/7 support)
- Glitch effects on text elements
- Skill progress bars with smooth filling with gradient colors

### 🎨 Portfolio Page - "3D Project Focus"

**Concept**: Projects aren't just displayed, but presented in 3D space with a unique effect of focusing on the active element.

#### Unique Elements:
- **Dynamic focus**: The active project smoothly moves to the center, becomes bright and detailed
- **Background grid**: Futuristic neon grid creates depth of technological space
- **Transparency of inactive elements**: Inactive projects remain semi-transparent for complete focus on the active one

#### Interactivity:
- Navigation with arrows, swipes, or keyboard
- Smooth transitions with "ejection" and "fading" effects of cards
- Animated technologies on project cards
- Progress indicators at the bottom of the carousel

### 📞 Contacts Page - "Banner of the Future and Neural Interface"

**Concept**: Contacts aren't just information, but a "neural interface" for connecting with a technological professional.

#### Unique Elements:
- **3D animated cube**: Central element with rotating neon lines as background
- **Information blocks**: Email, Phone, Telegram in stylized neon containers
